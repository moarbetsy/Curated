# Verification

- Follow `docs/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` section 1 (step cycle) and section 4 (verification + reporting).
- Run the most relevant checks for your changes (tests, lint, format, type check) when possible.
- If a check cannot be run, state why and what you did instead.
- If Precursor verification is configured, use `precursor.json > verification.commands` or the stack defaults.
