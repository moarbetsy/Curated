# Agent protocol

- Follow `docs/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` for the step cycle and failure loop.
- Use `docs/STEP_TEMPLATE.md` and append each completed step to `docs/STEPLOG.md`.
- If any command fails, stop and run the Failure Loop before continuing.
- Log real breakage to `docs/REPORT.md` only; never include secrets.
- Log agent-behavior incidents to `docs/INCIDENTS.md`.
