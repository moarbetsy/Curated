# Slash commands

- Command definitions live in `packages/precursor/precursor.json` or `.precursor/commands/*.json`.
- This repo includes `/apply-report` (`.precursor/commands/apply-report.json`) to list unresolved/mitigated issues and guide remediation.
- If a new command is required, add it under `.precursor/commands` and register it in `precursor.json`.
